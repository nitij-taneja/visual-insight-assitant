- Redis for caching and session storage
- File storage for video uploads and processed content
- Vector database for semantic search capabilities

### 1.2 Component Interaction Flow

The system operates through a sophisticated interaction flow designed to minimize latency and maximize user experience:

1. **Video Upload & Processing**: Users upload videos through the React frontend, which are immediately processed by the Django backend
2. **AI Analysis Pipeline**: Videos are analyzed using a multi-stage AI pipeline that includes object detection, activity recognition, and event classification
3. **Real-time Feedback**: As analysis progresses, real-time updates are sent to the frontend via WebSocket connections
4. **Conversational Interface**: Users can interact with the AI through natural language queries, with context maintained across multiple turns
5. **Insight Generation**: The system generates comprehensive summaries, alerts, and visual evidence based on the analysis results

## 2. Design Philosophy & User Experience

### 2.1 Design Principles

**Clarity Through Simplicity**
Our design philosophy centers on delivering complex AI capabilities through an intuitive, clean interface. We prioritize visual hierarchy, consistent spacing, and purposeful color usage to guide users naturally through their workflow.

**Contextual Intelligence**
Every element of the interface is designed to provide contextual information without overwhelming the user. Smart defaults, progressive disclosure, and adaptive layouts ensure that users see the right information at the right time.

**Accessibility First**
The system is built with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from the ground up, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability, can effectively utilize the platform's capabilities.
